# PipeControllerII
one class file game

Sometimes on Friday at work we write games :) Every developer writes his little game applcation.

All the games are small so that we can secretly embed them into our main application.

Rules of the game:
1. click on the cells to rotate pipe segments
2. connect pipes to make a path from upper glasses to bottom ones
3. try to connect as more glasses and as fast as you can!
4. scores are calculated as a sum of empty upper glasses and filled bottom ones

Application uses global leader board, you can install your own board - just copy `pipes.php` to any php-enabled web server.

Have fun!
